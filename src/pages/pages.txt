The "pages" folder contains components that represent individual pages of the application. 
Each file in this folder corresponds to a standalone page, such as "About," "Contact," "Pricing," etc. 
These components are usually rendered through React Router when the user navigates to specific routes. 
They can contain additional logic and structure to present a complete page view to the user.

In contrast the "components" folder contains more of the business logic and modular logic of the application.
These pages are meant to be kept simpler and have one use case only.
Pages in this folder should not have any children components. 
If a page at any point needs a child component it should be moved to the "components" folder with it's children.
