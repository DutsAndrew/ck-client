The "components" folder contains reusable UI components that are used throughout the application. 
These components are meant to be generic and independent of specific pages or functionalities. 
They can be easily imported and used in different parts of the app, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
Each component in this folder is a "module" and or has access to children(s) components.

The "pages" folder in contrast contains all single page components or components that are not modular, or that are simpler than those found here.
