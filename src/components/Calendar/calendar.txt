The calendar module uses <Calendar /> as it's entry.

All other components in this folder will root in through <Calendar />

The <CalendarNav /> has a folder linked to it as the components there deal with a wide variety of UX roles that needed to be separated.

The Calendar component is meant to allow users to view all of their calendars (personal and teams) in one place.
Users can switch which calendar they are viewing and get a snapshot of each calendar in the Day, Week, Month, and Year view or view all of them at once. Users can perform CRUD operations on all events if authorized.
